YOU:2:0:"Mom how are you feeling now?"
MOM:2:0:"I've been through worse you know."
YOU:2:0:"That was a close call. What if it was worse?"
JOYCE:2:0:"What if no one was there to help you?"
MOM:2:0:"I know where this is going."
MOM:2:0:"You two want me to live in that nursing home."
YOU:2:0:"Yes. It's not like you don't know how to take care of yourself."
YOU:2:0:"Because of your age, there is a limited amount of things you can do by yourself"
JOYCE:2:0:"Since both of us are busy working and <son/daugter's name> is too young; we can't take care of you whenever you need us."
MOM:2:0:"This was a close call wasn't it. Fine. I won't argue anymore. Let's go check out some nursing homes."
