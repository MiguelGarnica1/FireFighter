YOU:1:0:"Hey mom. It's been a while. I'm sorry for not visiting more often."
MOM:1:0:"It's alright. You're probably busy fighting fires, taking care of your wife and child."
MOM:1:0:"Hey, I always knew you two would be together."
YOU:1:0:"You were just saying that so I would feel better."
MOM:1:0:"True, but you can't deny that I was right."
YOU:1:0:"Hey, I have to go. It's nice seeing you again."
MOM:1:0:"It was nice to see my only son."
YOU:1:0:"Hey are you sure you'll be ok by yourself."
MOM:1:0:"I will be fine. You go do your thing."
